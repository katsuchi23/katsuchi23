# 👋 Hi, I’m @katsuchi23

- 👀 I’m interested in **Machine Learning**, especially **LLMs (Large Language Models)** and **Computer Vision**. These fields are where magic meets science! ✨🤖
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into **LLMs** and **VLMs (Vision-Language Models)**, learning how to make machines see and speak intelligently. 📚🖼️💬
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **LLM-related projects**! If you’re building something cool in this space, let’s team up. 🚀
- 📫 You can reach me via **reynaldywidjaja3@gmail.com**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe AI isn’t just about algorithms but also about how to make it more fun if you know what I mean 👀
