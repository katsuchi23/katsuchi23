# 👋 Hi, I’m @katsuchi23

👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, especially LLMs (Large Language Models) and Computer Vision. These fields are where magic meets science! ✨🤖

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into LLMs and VLMs (Vision-Language Models), learning how to make machines see and speak intelligently. 📚🖼️💬

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on LLM-related projects! If you’re building something cool in this space, let’s team up. 🚀

⚡ Fun fact: I believe AI isn’t just about algorithms but also about how to make it more fun if you know what I mean 👀
